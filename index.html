        <h1>Welcome to my Hebrew Bible studies website!</h1>
        <p>Throughout my decades long journey as a Biblical Hebrew teacher and scholar, I have created dozens of text based courses, which I now invite you to join.</p>

        <p>If you are curious about the Hebrew bible, wish to gain some insight through reading it in its original language and already have some background studying Hebrew, you are in the right place! The courses consist of 7 classes, 45 min. each, where we read (in Hebrew) and hold in-depth discussions on a segment of 3-4 verses, in addition to other comparisons, with a special focus on biblical Hebrew language. We explore the texts from a primarily academic approach, comparing them to each other and other ancient near eastern sources. We also discuss possible meanings of rare or difficult words in different contexts, explore rabbis' takes on them and much more.</p>
