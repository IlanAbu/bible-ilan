                <p>Shalom! My name is Ilan Abutbul. Starting in 2011, before I even graduated my studies at Haifa University in northern Israel, I have been teaching Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic in a few online schools, while working in parallel as a high school bible teacher (which is a mandatory subject in the Israeli school system).</p>

                <p>As years went by, I realized teaching adults who are curious and enthusiast about the most consequential Hebrew text to have ever been written, is my call, and shifted fully to online teaching.</p>

                <p>Over the years I produced hundreds of study units within a few dozens of courses I am excited to offer you today. These courses are based on a hands-on approach for students of Biblical & modern Hebrew and Aramaic who wish to apply the theoretical and general knowledge they acquire to specific text units, thus deepening their knowledge of these intriguing texts in their original language. I invite you to choose from my available courses about different biblical texts, and join a beautiful community of learners who meet, study and discuss in depth chosen texts. See you in class!</p>
